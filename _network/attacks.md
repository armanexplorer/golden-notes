**IP Spoofing:**
IP spoofing is a cyberattack where an attacker sends IP packets with a modified source IP address to pretend to be another machine. This technique is often used in man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. By spoofing the IP address, attackers can hide their true identity and potentially disrupt network services by overwhelming targets with network traffic.

**Injection Attacks:**
Injection attacks involve malicious code that injects hostile commands into a web application. One type of injection attack is content spoofing, where an attacker exploits an injection vulnerability to supply content to a web application, typically via a parameter value, that is reflected back to the user. This attack presents the user with a modified page under the context of a trusted domain, potentially leading to various consequences such as spreading malware, stealing information, or launching other attacks.
