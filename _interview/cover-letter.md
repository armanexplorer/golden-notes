I am excited to apply for a position at CloudLinux, a company that aligns with one of my long-standing career goals - to work in a Linux OS developing company. With my deep Python experience and extensive DevOps experience in Linux-based servers, specifically CentOS and Debian, I am confident that I can contribute to the company's success by making its OS more profitable and stable, making it a widely used choice by data centers and hosting providers.
