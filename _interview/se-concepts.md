## clean code and clean architecture

### Clean Code

Clean code refers to writing code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. It follows best practices, such as meaningful variable names, proper indentation, consistent formatting, and clear comments. Clean code is essential for collaboration among team members, as well as for the long-term sustainability and scalability of a software project.

### Clean Architecture

Clean architecture is a design approach that emphasizes separation of concerns and modularity in software systems. It aims to create systems that are flexible, maintainable, and testable by defining clear boundaries between different layers or components of the application. Clean architecture typically involves layers like presentation, domain logic, and data access, with each layer having specific responsibilities and dependencies managed in a way that allows for easy changes without affecting other parts of the system.
